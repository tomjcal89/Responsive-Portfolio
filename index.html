                Hello! My name is Thomas I was born and raised here in the Bay Area. Some people refer to me as the
                insurance guy.
                I currently work at State Farm (and no, I do not wear khakis). I first got into insurance when I moved
                to Austin, Texas
                in 2015 where I started to work for Progressive (no, I don’t know Flo, but I did take a picture with
                her cardboard cutout once).
                Before I moved to Austin, I was a Customer Service Manager at Old Navy in Downtown San Francisco. I did
                that for about 5 years, and let me tell you, retail is brutal.
            </p>

            <p>
                Something unique about myself I would say is that I have a blackbelt in Tae Kwon Do. Now, I got it when
                I was 13 and haven’t
                practiced it since I was 14, so I wouldn’t say I know much anymore. But, seeing how I do have a
                blackbelt, its has always a fun
                little fact to share with people.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have always been fascinated with coding and how it makes everything work. I was never able to fully
                commit to learning it
                because of my busy schedule. Now that I have the time, I am finally getting to do what I want and I
                know it is going tom be
                lifechanging. I cannot wait to see where this journey takes me.
            </p>
